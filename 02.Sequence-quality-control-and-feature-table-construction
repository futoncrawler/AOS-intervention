QIIME 2 plugins are available for several quality control methods, 
including DADA2, Deblur, and basic quality-score-based filtering. 
In this tutorial we present this step using DADA2 and Deblur. 
These steps are interchangeable, so you can use whichever of these you prefer.
The result of both of these methods will be a FeatureTable[Frequency] QIIME 2 artifact,
which contains counts (frequencies) of each unique sequence in each sample in the dataset,
and a FeatureData[Sequence] QIIME 2 artifact, 
which maps feature identifiers in the FeatureTable to the sequences they represent.

DADA2 is a pipeline for detecting and correcting (where possible) Illumina amplicon sequence data.
As implemented in the q2-dada2 plugin, this quality control process will additionally filter any
phiX reads (commonly present in marker gene Illumina sequence data) that are identified in the
sequencing data, and will filter chimeric sequences.

The dada2 denoise-single method requires two parameters that are used in quality filtering:
--p-trim-left m, which trims off the first m bases of each sequence, and --p-trunc-len n which truncates
each sequence at position n. This allows the user to remove low quality regions of the sequences.
To determine what values to pass for these two parameters, you should review 
the Interactive Quality Plot tab in the demux.qzv file that was generated by qiime demux summarize above.

In DADA2, those sequences are changed to match the sequence from which they're inferred to have arisen.
In Deblur, those sequences are removed.
