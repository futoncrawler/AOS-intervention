QIIME 2 plugins are available for several quality control methods,  including DADA2, Deblur, and basic quality-score-based filtering. 
In DADA2, error sequences are changed to match the sequence from which they're inferred to have arisen.
In Deblur, those sequences are removed.
DADA2 is a pipeline for detecting and correcting (where possible) Illumina amplicon sequence data.
As implemented in the q2-dada2 plugin, this quality control process will additionally filter any
phiX reads (commonly present in marker gene Illumina sequence data) that are identified in the
sequencing data, and will filter chimeric sequences.

The dada2 denoise-single method requires two parameters that are used in quality filtering:
--p-trim-left m, which trims off the first m bases of each sequence, and --p-trunc-len n which truncates
each sequence at position n. This allows the user to remove low quality regions of the sequences.
To determine what values to pass for these two parameters, you should review 
the Interactive Quality Plot tab in the demux-paired-end.qzv file that was generated by qiime demux summarize above.

#Below is the general way to conduct dada2 denoise function, we don't use this command directly this time:
qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs demux-paired-end.qza \
  --p-trim-left-f e.g.:15 \
  --p-trim-left-r e.g.:15 \
  --p-trunc-len-f e.g.:240 \
  --p-trunc-len-r e.g.:240 \
  --o-table table.qza \
  --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs.qza \
  --o-denoising-stats denoising-stats.qza

Expected Output Artifacts:
1. FeatureTable[Frequency] table.qza
2. FeatureData[Sequence] rep-seqs.gza
3. SampleData[Dada2Stats] denoising-stats.qza

But this time we will first conduct subsample paired sequences. This plugin is optional, it functions to generate a random
subsample of paired-end sequences containing approximately the fraction of input sequences specified by the fraction parameter. The
number of output samples will always be equal to the number of input samples, even if some of those samples contain no sequences after
subsampling.
Benefits of using subsample paired-end

1. Reducing Computational Cost:
Paired-end sequencing can generate massive amounts of data, which can be computationally intensive to analyze.
Subsampling allows researchers to work with a smaller, more manageable subset of reads, significantly reducing processing time and memory requirements.

2. Validating Analysis Pipelines:
Subsampling can be used to test and validate the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis pipelines before running them on the full dataset.
This is particularly useful for complex analyses like de novo assembly or variant calling.

3. Creating Representative Datasets:
In some cases, subsampling can help create a representative subset of reads that accurately reflects the overall characteristics of the original dataset.
This can be useful for exploring data distribution, identifying potential biases, or creating training datasets for machine learning models.

4. Balancing Read Depth:
Subsampling can help balance the read depth across different regions or samples, especially when dealing with uneven coverage.
This can lead to more accurate downstream analyses, such as variant calling or differential gene expression analysis.
